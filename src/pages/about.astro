          Why We Built This
        </h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-8">
          Cost often determines choices. When sustainable options are more expensive, people pick what they can afford. The programs listed here help close that gap.

          The Environmental Case
        </h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
          Many of these programs have environmental benefits:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li><strong>Transit discounts</strong> reduce car trips and emissions</li>
          <li><strong>Libraries and tool-lending</strong> mean less stuff manufactured and thrown away</li>
          <li><strong>Food assistance</strong> helps reduce food waste by matching supply to need</li>
          <li><strong>Utility programs</strong> (CARE, FERA, ESA) lower energy use through efficiency upgrades</li>
          <li><strong>Free park access</strong> gets more people outdoors</li>
        </ul>

          Who This Is For
        </h2>

        <div class="bg-primary-50 dark:bg-primary-900/20 border-l-4 border-primary-500 p-4 rounded-r-lg mb-4">
          <p class="text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300">
            This is for anyone who lives in the Bay Area and wants to save money. It doesn't matter how much money you make—there are programs for everyone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
          Anyone in the nine-county Bay Area: low-income households, seniors, veterans, students, people with disabilities, families, or anyone looking to save money.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-8">
          We added <a href="/eligibility">Eligibility Guides</a> because knowing about a discount isn't useful if you don't know whether you qualify or how to apply. These guides cover programs like Medi-Cal, CalFresh, veteran benefits, student discounts, and utility assistance.

          Our Principles
        </h2>
        <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li>
            <strong>Privacy-first</strong>: No tracking, no cookies, no personal data collection. Zero data collection is possible—the site works fully offline.
            <a href="https://github.com/baytides/baynavigator">Open source on GitHub</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No paid listings</strong>: We don't take money for any listing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessible</strong>: WCAG 2.2 compliant with keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community maintained</strong>: We update regularly and welcome corrections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disaster-ready</strong>: Install as an app before emergencies. All program data is cached offline—no internet required during wildfires, earthquakes, or power outages.
          </li>
        </ul>

          How We're Different
        </h2>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
          There are other resource directories in the Bay Area, including <a href="https://211bayarea.org">211 Bay Area</a> (which we recommend for comprehensive searches). Bay Navigator takes a different approach:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-8">
          <li>
            <strong>Zero burden on agencies</strong>: We pull from existing government open data APIs. Organizations don't need to apply, submit forms, or commit to annual updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Federal benefits included</strong>: We integrate USA.gov's Benefit Finder data for nationwide programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI-powered search</strong>: Natural language queries like "I'm a 68-year-old senior in San Mateo who needs help with bills" work seamlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offline-first</strong>: Works without internet once installed—critical during emergencies when networks are down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open source</strong>: Anyone can contribute, fork, or verify what we do.
          </li>
        </ul>
