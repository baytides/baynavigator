            AI-Powered Search
          </h2>
          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
            Bay Navigator includes an optional AI-powered search feature that helps you find programs using natural language queries (e.g., "I'm a senior who needs help with utility bills"). Here's how it works:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li><strong>When AI is used:</strong> Complex or natural language queries are sent to our Azure Function for processing. Simple keyword searches (like "food" or "healthcare") use local fuzzy search and never contact any server.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline mode:</strong> When you're offline, AI search is automatically disabled. All searches use local fuzzy matching instead—no failed requests, no errors.</li>
            <li><strong>No storage:</strong> We do not store your search queries on our servers. Queries are processed and immediately discarded.</li>
            <li><strong>No identifiers:</strong> Searches are not linked to any personal identifier, account, or session.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-party processing:</strong> AI queries are processed by Azure OpenAI. Microsoft Azure processes data in accordance with their privacy policies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-6">
            <strong>To avoid AI entirely:</strong> Switch the "Smart Search" toggle to off, or use Bay Navigator offline. When offline, all data is served from your device's cache and no network requests are made.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">
            Hosting and Infrastructure
          </h2>
          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
            Bay Navigator is hosted on Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps and uses Cloudflare for content delivery and security. Standard server logs may include:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>IP addresses (for security and rate limiting)</li>
            <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
            <li>Pages visited and timestamps</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-6">
            These logs are used for security purposes only and are not used to identify or track individuals. Logs are retained according to Microsoft Azure and Cloudflare's standard retention policies.

            Analytics
          </h2>
          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-4">
            We use a self-hosted instance of Plausible Analytics to collect de-identified, aggregate usage data. This helps us understand how Bay Navigator is used without tracking individuals. We collect only:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Country accessed from</li>

            <li>Operating system and version</li>

          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-6">
            Plausible does not use cookies, does not collect personal data, and does not track users across sites. All data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individuals.

            Do Not Track Signals

          <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 mb-6">
            Bay Navigator honors Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals. Because we do not track users, no action is required when we receive a DNT signal—our default behavior is already privacy-respecting.

            Bay Navigator does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13, in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
