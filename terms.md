## 10. Governing Law and Mandatory Arbitration {#governing-law-and-dispute-resolution}

### Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is excluded.

### MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

#### Agreement to Arbitrate

You and Bay Tides agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Website, or any aspect of your relationship with Bay Tides (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved exclusively through **final and binding individual arbitration**, rather than in court, except as set forth below.

#### Waiver of Class Actions

**YOU AND BAY TIDES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.** Unless both you and Bay Tides agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class, collective, or representative proceeding.

#### Informal Resolution First

Before initiating arbitration, you agree to first contact us at privacy [at] baytides [dot] org to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the dispute by contacting you via email. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days, either party may proceed to arbitration.

#### Arbitration Procedures

Any arbitration shall be administered by **JAMS** under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as modified by this agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall take place in San Mateo County, California, or at another mutually agreed location, or via videoconference if agreed by the parties.

#### Arbitration Fees

Each party shall initially bear its own filing fees and share equally in the arbitrator's fees. However, if you prevail in the arbitration, Bay Tides will reimburse your filing fees and pay the full arbitrator's fees for disputes involving $5,000 or less. For disputes involving more than $5,000, the arbitrator shall determine the allocation of fees based on the outcome and merits of the case.

#### Exceptions to Arbitration

Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within the court's jurisdiction. Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights.

#### Opt-Out

You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to Bay Tides via email at privacy [at] baytides [dot] org within fourteen (14) days of first using the Website. Your notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration agreement. If you opt out, you will not be precluded from using the Website, but this arbitration agreement will not apply to you.

#### Survival

This arbitration agreement will survive termination of your relationship with Bay Tides and your use of the Website.

### Jurisdiction for Non-Arbitrated Matters

For any matters not subject to arbitration, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Mateo County, California.

---

## 11. Severability {#severability}

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision is severable and the remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. If a provision is found to be unenforceable, the court may modify it to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving its original intent.

---

## 12. Entire Agreement {#entire-agreement}

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other policies published on the Website, constitute the entire agreement between you and Bay Tides regarding your use of the Website.
