# Bay Navigator - Program Data

This directory contains all program data for BayNavigator.com.

## 🔄 YAML + Cosmos DB Architecture

**These YAML files serve multiple purposes:**
1. **Version Control** - Track all program changes via Git history
2. **Backup** - Redundant copy of data stored in Azure Cosmos DB
3. **Open Source** - Anyone can view and download the complete dataset
4. **Easy Contributions** - Submit PRs to update programs
5. **Migration Source** - Can re-sync to Cosmos DB anytime

**The live website uses Azure Cosmos DB via API, not these YAML files directly.**

To sync YAML changes to the database, run:
```bash
cd scripts
npm install
npm run migrate
```

See [AZURE_INTEGRATION.md](../../docs/AZURE_INTEGRATION.md) for details.
