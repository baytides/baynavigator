# About Bay Navigator

**Bay Navigator** is a community resource project of [Bay Tides](https://baytides.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the San Francisco Bay through education, advocacy, and action.

## Why We Built This

We started Bay Navigator because we see a direct connection between **financial barriers and environmental harm**.

When cost is the deciding factor, the cheapest option is often the most damaging—to the environment, to wildlife, and to public health. Driving an old car is cheaper than transit fares. Fast fashion costs less than durable clothing. Processed food is more affordable than local produce. Inefficient appliances stay in use because replacements are out of reach.

The programs listed here change that calculus. They make sustainable choices financially viable for people who would otherwise be priced out of them.

## The Environmental Case

Much of what Bay Navigator promotes is inherently environmental:

### Transit Over Cars

Every discount that makes BART, Muni, Caltrain, or AC Transit more accessible reduces vehicle miles traveled, eases congestion, and cuts emissions. Public transit is one of the most impactful climate interventions available in urban areas, and cost is often the barrier to adoption.

### Sharing Over Owning

Libraries, tool libraries, and sharing programs mean fewer resources extracted, manufactured, and eventually landfilled. When 50 households share one circular saw through a tool library instead of buying 50 individual saws, that's material reduction at scale. This is practical degrowth, even if nobody calls it that.

### Food Systems and Waste

CalFresh and food assistance programs help families buy what they need rather than over-purchasing and discarding. Food banks and community meal programs redistribute surplus that would otherwise be wasted. The connection between food security and food waste is direct.

### Energy Efficiency

Utility assistance programs like CARE, FERA, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program don't just reduce bills—they reduce consumption. Weatherization upgrades, efficient appliances, and behavioral changes driven by these programs translate to measurable emissions reductions.

### Connection to Place

When a family visits Crissy Field, Coyote Hills, or Point Reyes because a transit discount or free park day made it possible, we're building the constituency for conservation. People protect what they love, and they love what they experience. Access to public lands creates future advocates for open space.

## Who This Is For

<div class="simple-language-summary" aria-label="Simple language summary">
This is for anyone who lives in the Bay Area and wants to save money. It doesn't matter how much money you make - there are programs for everyone.
</div>

Bay Navigator serves anyone in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area looking to stretch their resources—low-income households, seniors, veterans and military families, students, people with disabilities, families looking for free activities, or anyone who wants to reduce expenses and live more sustainably.

As we built out the discount listings, we realized many visitors didn't know if they qualified for the programs we were listing. Someone might discover that EBT cardholders get discounted museum admission—but if they don't have an EBT card and don't know how to apply, that information isn't useful.

So we expanded. Our [Eligibility Guides](/eligibility/) help residents understand how to apply for public assistance programs like Medi-Cal and CalFresh, who qualifies for military and veteran benefits, what counts as valid student status, age thresholds for senior programs, disability services and accommodations, and utility assistance options.

We're not benefits counselors, and we're not trying to replace the social workers and case managers who do that work. But we can point people in the right direction and demystify processes that often feel opaque.

We focus on the Bay Area because that's where we live and work, and because local knowledge matters. Knowing which county office to visit, which transit agency serves your area, and which programs have Bay Area-specific rules requires regional expertise.

## Our Principles

### Privacy by Design

We don't collect personal information, set cookies, or track users. People seeking assistance deserve privacy. Our entire codebase is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/baytides/baynavigator) so anyone can verify our claims.

### No Compensation for Listings

We don't receive payment, commissions, or referral fees for any program we list. Every listing is included because we believe it's genuinely useful to Bay Area residents.

### Accessibility First

The site is designed to meet WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards. We offer translation features, adjustable text spacing, and keyboard navigation because access to information shouldn't depend on ability.

### Community Maintained

This is a living resource. Programs change, new discounts emerge, and eligibility rules shift. We update listings regularly and welcome corrections and additions from the community.
