## Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Pre-commit hooks automatically format staged files
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:

- `feat(directory): add filter by county`
- `fix(search): handle empty query`
- `docs(readme): update installation steps`

## Adding Program Data

Program data lives in `src/data/*.yml`. Each program should include:

```yaml
- name: Program Name
  description: Brief description
  category: Category name
  eligibility: Who is eligible
  how_to_apply: Application instructions
  link: https://example.com
  agency: Providing agency
```

After adding data, run `npm run build` to regenerate the API.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### Accessibility Tests

```bash
npm run test:a11y
```

We maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. All new components must pass accessibility tests.
